# Unit 03 - File and Exception Handling

Unit 03 focuses on writing robust programs using:
- file handling (read/write, modes, directories),
- exceptions (try/except/else/finally, raise/assert),
- modular code organization (modules and packages),
- and regular expressions for pattern matching.

## Lectures
- Lecture 01: File Handling Fundamentals and Directories
- Lecture 02: Errors vs Exceptions and Exception Handling

- Use `notes.pdf` for detailed explanations and teaching flow.
- Run demo scripts in `demo/` during the lecture.

## Compile
From repo root:
