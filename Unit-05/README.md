# Unit 05 - Classes and Objects in Python (OOP)

Unit 05 introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:
- classes and objects,
- methods, constructors, special methods,
- class vs instance variables,
- public/private members, garbage collection, abstract classes,
- inheritance and polymorphism (overriding, operator overloading).

- Lecture 02: Data Members, Class Attributes, Garbage Collection, Abstract Classes
- Lecture 03: Inheritance and Types of Inheritance
- Lecture 04: Polymorphism (Overriding and Operator Overloading)

## How to Use
- Open `slides.pdf` for in-class teaching.
- Use `notes.pdf` for detailed explanations and teaching flow.
- Run demo scripts in `demo/` during the lecture.

## Compile
From repo root:
