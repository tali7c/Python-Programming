# Experiment 02 - Conditional Statements

## Objective
Practice writing programs using:
- `if/elif/else` and nested conditions,
- numeric comparisons,
- and simple real-world decision logic.

## Prerequisites
- Variables, type conversion, operators

## Exercises (Scripts)
1. `scripts/01_divisible_3_and_5.py` - Divisible by both 3 and 5
2. `scripts/02_multiple_of_5.py` - Multiple of 5 check
3. `scripts/03_max_of_two.py` - Greatest among two numbers (handle equality)
4. `scripts/04_max_of_three.py` - Greatest among three distinct numbers
5. `scripts/05_quadratic_roots.py` - Roots of quadratic equation (real/imaginary)
6. `scripts/06_leap_year.py` - Leap year check
7. `scripts/07_next_date.py` - Next date in calendar
8. `scripts/08_grade_sheet.py` - Percentage, CGPA, and grade sheet

## Explanations (PDF)
- Compiled PDFs are in `explanations/`
- LaTeX sources are in `explanations/latex/`

## Exercise Sheet (No Solutions)
- `exercises.pdf` contains only problem statements (no scripts, no solutions).

## Evaluation Rubric (Suggested)
- Correctness: 4
- Input validation / edge cases: 2
- Code clarity: 2
- Output formatting: 1
- Viva: 1

## Viva Questions (Sample)
1. Difference between `if` and `elif`?
2. How do you handle multiple conditions in one `if` statement?
3. What is a leap year rule?
4. When can quadratic roots become imaginary?
5. Why is date validation tricky (month lengths, leap years)?
