# Experiment 05 - Collections (List/Tuple/Dict) and Mini-Apps

## Objective
Practice Python **collections** and build small menu-driven programs using
lists and dictionaries.

## Prerequisites
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Sorting and basic algorithms
- Loops and functions (basic)

## Exercises (Scripts)
1. `scripts/01_count_0_3.py` - Count occurrences of values 0..3
2. `scripts/02_tuple_avg.py` - Create tuple and compute average
3. `scripts/03_runner_up.py` - Find runner-up score (2nd highest distinct)
4. `scripts/04_city_dict.py` - Name-city dictionary + counts per city
5. `scripts/05_movies_dict.py` - Movie dictionary queries (year/profit/director)
6. `scripts/06_contact_book.py` - Contact book (add/search/update/delete)
7. `scripts/07_todo_list.py` - Todo list manager (add/view/remove)

## Explanations (PDF)
- Compiled PDFs are in `explanations/`
- LaTeX sources are in `explanations/latex/`

## Evaluation Rubric (Suggested)
- Correctness: 4
- Data structure choice: 2
- Edge cases (duplicates, empty input): 2
- Output formatting: 1
- Viva: 1

## Viva Questions (Sample)
1. Why use a `set` before finding the runner-up score?
2. Difference between `dict[key]` and `dict.get(key)`?
3. Average-case complexity of dictionary lookup?
4. How would you persist contact book data between runs?
5. Why is input validation important in menu-driven apps?
