# Experiment 04 - Strings and Sets

## Objective
Practice:
- string processing (counting, splitting, substring frequency),
- basic text analysis (case-insensitive counts),
- and set operations (uniqueness, union/intersection/difference).

## Prerequisites
- Variables, input/output
- Loops and conditionals
- Strings (Unit 01) and sets (Unit 02)

## Exercises (Scripts)
1. `scripts/01_count_capitals.py` - Count capital letters in a string
2. `scripts/02_count_vowels.py` - Count vowels in a string
3. `scripts/03_words_per_line.py` - Print each word of a sentence on a new line
4. `scripts/04_substring_count.py` - Count occurrences of a substring (left-to-right)
5. `scripts/05_letter_frequency_case_insensitive.py` - Alphabet frequency (case-insensitive)
6. `scripts/06_unique_words_set.py` - Count unique words using a set
7. `scripts/07_fruits_set_tasks.py` - Two fruit sets: common, only in s1, total count
8. `scripts/08_set_operations_demo.py` - Apply set operations on sample sets

## Exercise Sheet (No Solutions)
- `exercises.pdf` contains only problem statements (no scripts, no solutions).

## Evaluation Rubric (Suggested)
- Correctness: 4
- Use of string/set concepts: 2
- Input handling / edge cases: 2
- Output formatting: 1
- Viva: 1

## Viva Questions (Sample)
1. Difference between `str.count()` and manual counting using a loop?
2. What does `split()` return and when is it useful?
3. Why do sets remove duplicates automatically?
4. Difference between union, intersection, and difference?
5. How can you make counting case-insensitive?
