\maketitle

\section*{Objective}
Create two sets of fruits and find:
\begin{itemize}
  \item fruits in both sets,
  \item fruits only in the first set,
  \item count of all unique fruits from both sets.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Input}
Number of fruits $n$ and fruit names for sets \texttt{s1} and \texttt{s2}.

\section*{Output}
Intersection, difference, union, and the union size.

\section*{Approach}
Use set operations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Intersection: \texttt{s1 \& s2}
  \item Difference: \texttt{s1 - s2}
  \item Union: \texttt{s1 | s2}
  \item Count of all unique fruits: \texttt{len(s1 | s2)}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Time Complexity}
\texttt{O(n)} average-case for building sets and computing operations.
