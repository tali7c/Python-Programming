# Unit 06 - Data Analysis and Visualization

Unit 06 introduces Python tools used in data analysis:
- NumPy (arrays and numerical computing)
- Pandas (Series/DataFrame data handling)
- Matplotlib (plotting and visualization)

Syllabus coverage includes array creation, broadcasting, statistics, missing data,
CSV import/export, and multiple plot types with subplots.

## Lectures
- Lecture 01: NumPy Basics (ndarray, creation, attributes, operations, broadcasting)
- Lecture 02: NumPy Functions (math/statistics/sorting/searching)
- Lecture 03: Pandas Basics (Series and DataFrame operations)
- Lecture 04: Missing Data, Aggregation, Combining DataFrames, CSV I/O
- Lecture 05: Matplotlib Fundamentals (pyplot, labels, grid, customization)
- Lecture 06: Plot Types and Subplots (line, bar, hist, scatter, pie, subplots)
